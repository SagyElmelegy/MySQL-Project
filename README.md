This project is about the world layoffs occured after the corona virus hit the world and companies had to lay off their employees during the years 2020 to 2023.
The layoffs dataset contains huge amount of data but on the other hand, it is not clean enough to make further processes and gain insights from it.
So I started by cleaning the data according to multiple steps I worked according to (They are stated in comments in the code in DataCleaning2.sql file).
After finishig the cleaning process, I had to do some Explanatory Data Analysis on the dataset to gain some more insights that I might use in the future.
